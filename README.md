# Multiply 4x4 Matrices (32-bit) with Assembly, C++, and AVX

This repository contains implementations in Assembly, C++, and AVX for multiplying two 4x4 matrices.

## Description

The purpose of this project is to compare the performance of matrix multiplication across different programming languages and optimization techniques. Three implementations are provided:

- **Assembly**: Matrix multiplication implemented in assembly language.
- **C++**: Matrix multiplication implemented in C++.
- **AVX**: Matrix multiplication implemented using AVX instructions for vectorization.
